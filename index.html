            <p>
            And she didn't know how to tell him She was in love with a Rasta man Fire was burning and burning To let out what she was holding in And she didn't know how to tell him She was in love with a Rasta man Fire was burning and burning To let out what she was holding in

            Know her story before she say it Daddy just want her cooperate Find somebody that's corporate Suit and tie more appropriate Him say him naa make him daughter stray But Reggae music she start fi play it Ital food when she sort her plate Militant yute wah she want fi date And that is what she need Marcus Garvey she start fi read Hair stop comb and it start look neat So him want keep her off the street from who she with And that be me More than a natty head is what she see No lovers leap is not for me And she nuh waa keep it a secret but she can't tell him who she sleep with

        <!--second verse-->
        <p>[Verse 2 - Protoje:]</p>
            <p>
             And she wants to be free From all this captivity So she'll be who she will be They can't tell her who she need They can't tell her who she want, who she can't She talk her owner chant, chart her owner path And follow her owner heart Call me over her own apartment Now as I answer the phone that's the tone she start with She know say she don't fi part with One like I even though so much impart it But she haffi do her owner thing Cause she can never live life for them Knowing that she would look back when To the time when she couldn't explain to him cause then
